# Human Following Luggage Carrying Robot

> This embedded systems project introduces a BLE+RF enabled robot designed to follow a person by triangulating signal strength and reacting in real-time. Developed using ESP32 and sensor modules.

---

### 📌 **Project Overview**
- **Objective:** Create a smart luggage robot that can follow a human using RF/BLE signals, allowing hands-free luggage management in indoor environments.
- **Methodology:** The robot uses ESP32 microcontrollers paired with RF transmitters/receivers and BLE for distance estimation. Signal strength data is used to determine direction and follow commands.
